          <li>Laws of Motion: Newton formulated the three laws of motion, which describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws are fundamental in classical mechanics and are still used today.</li>
          <li>Universal Gravitation: Newton proposed the law of universal gravitation, which states that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This law explains the force of gravity and has implications ranging from celestial mechanics to everyday phenomena.</li>
          <li>Calculus: Newton, along with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, independently developed calculus, a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation of quantities. His work laid the foundation for much of classical physics and mathematics.</li>
